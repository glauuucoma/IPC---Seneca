 <h3>Introduction to Programming Using C</h3>
<br/>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the GitHub repository for your Introduction to Programming Using C (IPC144) school projects. This repository contains various projects and assignments related 
  to the IPC144 course. This course covers the fundamental principles of computer programming with a focus on problem-solving 
  strategies using structured programming techniques. The C programming language is used to introduce problem analysis, algorithm design, 
  and program implementation.</p>

<h2>Essential Skills</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.</li>
    <li>Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.</li>
    <li>Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Design functions using selection and iteration constructs to solve a programming task.</li>
    <li>Connect functions using pass-by-value and pass-by-address semantics to assemble a complete program.</li>
    <li>Design collections using arrays and structures to manage data efficiently.</li>
    <li>Code algorithms using standard library functions to incorporate existing technology.</li>
    <li>Code complete programs using appropriate object and pointer types to solve programming problems.</li>
</ol>
